# SvelteKit Exec Adapter

**Experimental** | **v{PACKAGE_VERSION}**

> ⚠️ **Experimental Project:** This adapter is currently under active development and testing. Use with caution in production environments.

A SvelteKit adapter that builds your full-stack web application as a **single executable binary** with zero runtime dependencies.

Unlike static builds that strip away server capabilities, this adapter preserves **all server-side features** of SvelteKit: SSR, API endpoints, server middleware, server-side authentication, and more.

## Why Use This Adapter?

### Traditional Approaches Lose Functionality

- SPA builds + Rust/Go → Lose SvelteKit's server features
- Desktop apps → Can't be deployed to the web
- Docker → Requires Docker installation and container management

### With SvelteKit Exec Adapter

- ✅ Full SvelteKit capabilities preserved
- ✅ Single binary, no runtime dependencies
- ✅ Cross-platform executable
- ✅ Runs anywhere: locally or on cloud machines

## Perfect For

### Open-Source Tools

Users can run your tools without Docker/Node.js installation requirements.

### Commercial Software

Sell as one-time purchase for self-hosting with complete functionality.

### Privacy-Focused Apps

Prioritize local data ownership with offline-capable applications.

**Example use cases:** AI chat applications, project management tools, content management systems, web analytics dashboards, development tools, and more.

## Quick Installation

> 📋 **Requirements:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) is required as a build dependency to compile your SvelteKit application into an executable binary.

```bash
# Install the adapter
npm install sveltekit-exec-adapter

# Install Bun (build dependency)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Configuration

Add the adapter to your `svelte.config.js`:

```javascript
import adapter from 'sveltekit-exec-adapter';

const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			// Optional configuration
			out: 'build',
			name: 'my-app'
		})
	}
};

export default config;
```

## Build Your Application

```bash
# Build the executable
npm run build

# Run your standalone application
./build/my-app
```

Your SvelteKit application is now a **single executable file** that can be distributed and run anywhere without any dependencies!
